# YouTube Trends Self Analysis

## Self Assessment
In the beginning of the project, I had intended to take up the database management role - but when that role was absorbed 
by Cameron I switched tracks and took over the creation of the app. I worked with Ryan to figure out what kind of model 
needed to be exported from his machine learning model to integrate into flask, and then built the structure of the page around that. 
Flask wasn't one of my stronger modules during the course, so revisitng that was a challenge but by checking through the code line 
by line, the app worked in the end.
Working with the group was difficult in multiple aspects - it was not a project I wanted to work on as far as the topic, and most of 
my team members lacked motivation or drive to work on anything without prompting; which is a good segway into...

## Team Assessment
The team lacked focus and motivation. Three out of the five of us did very little without guidance and prompting, or even read 
the material provided that gave a very clear roadmap on how to divide up tasks, what taks needed to be done, and what the grading rubric was. 
There were a lot of promises made of thigns that would be accomplished and not a lot of follow through. Ryan was great - every 
team needs a Ryan. He took on the machine learning task and worked on it until it worked. 
Most of our communication was through Slack. If I were to do this again I'd schedule extra meeting times outside of class, assign people 
roles and give them checklists (more than I did this time).

## Summary of Project
 - Topic - Trending Videos on YouTube - We analysed how long a video would take before it was trending on Youtune if it was going to 
 do so, and how many views one could expect once it reached trending. We did not have ther right data to determine the chance of that 
 occuring (no non-trending videos in the dataset).
 - The machine learning module used was BalancedRandomForestRegressor 
 - [Results were in the form of an app.](https://trendingpickles.herokuapp.com/)
