Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time. \n\nBy Design is a new Vox video series about the intersection of design and technology, hosted by Christophe Haubursin.

Lettering is always a challenge to build in dominoes based off a picture because you have to be extremely precise to make the font look right (here's the original picture: http://bit.ly/2DylugC). Lots of proportions, measuring, and eye-balling were needed for this project. It was also a challenge to figure out how to get this to topple sequentially by letter, since everything was connected in cursive (however, sometimes not in the direction it needed to topple). I had to tape down a few one way dominoes to ensure that the path would keep going in the right direction. Overall, this was a fun project to do and I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed building it :)\n\nWATCH MORE DOMINO VIDEOS HERE! 😊\n●YOUTUBERS in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2uRzTDf\n●My BEST domino projects ➡️ http://bit.ly/2swnIWN\n●Video games/movies in dominoes ➡️ http://bit.ly/2u8tZdx\n\nHey!

It hits theaters on May 25th.\n\nParamount Pictures and Skydance released the first Mission: Impossible Fallout trailer, teased first during the Super Bowl, then dropping the full length online soon after.

24,439802,"""False""","""False""","PADDINGTON 2 -  US Trailer 2 Warner Bros. Pictures In Theaters January 12, 2018\n\n Following the worldwide hit “Paddington,” one of the most successful family films of all time, this much-anticipated sequel finds Paddington (Ben Whishaw) happily settled with the Brown family in London, where he has become a popular member of the local community, spreading joy and marmalade wherever he goes.  \n\n While searching for the perfect present for his beloved Aunt Lucy’s hundredth birthday, Paddington sees a unique pop-up book in Mr. Gruber’s antique shop, and embarks upon a series of odd jobs to buy it.  But when the book is stolen, it’s up to Paddington and the Browns to unmask the thief.\n \n Reuniting many of the original film’s cast while welcoming those in new roles, “Paddington 2” stars Golden Globe nominee Hugh Bonneville (“Downton Abbey”), Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins (“Blue Jasmine”), three-time Golden Globe nominee Brendan Gleeson (“The Guard,” “Into the Storm,” “In Bruges”), Oscar nominee Julie Walters (“Billy Elliot,” “Educating Rita”), Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (“Iris”), and Oscar winner Peter Capaldi (short, “Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life”), with Golden Globe and BAFTA Award winner Hugh Grant (“Four Weddings and a Funeral”), and BAFTA winner Ben Whishaw (“The Hollow Crown”) as the voice of Paddington.  The starring ensemble also includes Madeleine Harris, Samuel Joslin, and Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (“Vera Drake”) as the voice of Aunt Lucy. \n\n Paddington’s return to the big screen was again helmed by BAFTA-nominated director Paul King (“Paddington,” “Come Fly with Me,” “The Mighty Boosh”) from a script written by King and Simon Farnaby (Sky TV’s “Yonderland,” “Mindhorn”), based on the best-selling and internationally adored books by Michael Bond, creator of Paddington Bear.  \n\n The film was produced by multiple award-winning producer David Heyman (the “Harry Potter” films, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” Oscar nominee for “Gravity”).   Serving as executive producers were Rosie Alison, Jeffrey Clifford, Alexandra Ferguson Derbyshire, Ron Halpern, and Didier Lupfer.  \n\n Creative talent returning behind the camera included director of photography Erik Alexander Wilson (“Tyrannosaur,” “Submarine”), production designer Gary Williamson (“Bunny and the Bull,” “Submarine”), Oscar-winning costume designer Lindy Hemming (“Wonder Woman,” “The Dark Knight”), and editor Mark Everson (“Mindhorn,” “Alan Partridge”), joined by editor Jonathan Amos (“Baby Driver”).  Visual effects were provided by the highly acclaimed British VFX company, Framestore, led by animation director Pablo Grillo (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”) and VFX supervisors Andy Kind (“Gravity”) and Glen Pratt (“Beauty and the Beast”).  The score is composed by Academy Award winner Dario Marianelli (“Atonement”).  \n\n “Paddington 2” was shot on location in and around central London, as well as on the legendary soundstages of Warner Bros. Leavesden and Pinewood film studios.\n\n Warner Bros. Pictures and STUDIOCANAL present, in association with Anton Capital Entertainment S.C.A., a Heyday Films Production, “Paddington 2.”  The film will be distributed by Warner Bros.

With over 200 million album sales worldwide, she was the only artist to chart seven consecutive U.S. No. 1 singles. She also starred in several blockbuster movies before her brilliant career gave way to erratic behavior, scandals and death at age 48. The documentary feature Whitney is an intimate, unflinching portrait of Houston and her family that probes beyond familiar tabloid headlines and sheds new light on the spellbinding trajectory of Houston’s life. Using never-before-seen archival footage, exclusive demo recordings, rare performances, audio archives and original interviews with the people who knew her best, Oscar®-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald unravels the mystery behind “The Voice,” who thrilled millions even as she struggled to make peace with her own troubled past.

Coming from a family of cinema legends, he himself became a film star, and then saw dizzying heights and darkest depths: adulation of diehard fans, unending battles with various addictions, brushes with the underworld, prison terms, loss of loved ones, and the haunting speculation that he might or might not be a terrorist.Sanju is in turns a hilarious and heartbreaking exploration of one man’s battle against his own wild self and the formidable external forces trying to crush him. It depicts the journey of a man through everything that life can throw at him. Some true stories leave you thinking “did this really happen?” This is one such unbelievable story that happens to be true.Starring: Ranbir Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Manisha Koirala, Anushka Sharma, Sonam Kapoor, Dia Mirza, Vicky Kaushal, Jim Sarbh and Boman Irani.

Most of these schools are run by publicly-traded companies, which means the profits they earn after running schools with taxpayer funds go toward paying their shareholders. These schools enroll less than 1% of American public school students right now, but the share is growing.  In their ads, these schools promise autonomy and flexibility. They appeal to students eager to escape bullies or classrooms where they feel unsuccessful. But the data show that attending these schools sets kids back academically— by a lot. And despite their poor performance, states have been slow to close these schools down.\n\nReading list: \n\nArianna Prothero and Maya Riser-Kositsky calculated the lobbying and campaign spending totals for K12 and Connections Academy for Education Week/edweek.org: https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2016/11/03/outsized-influence-online-charters-bring-lobbying-a.html\n\nThis 2015 study from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University is the most comprehensive nationwide look at online charters to date. Researchers there found that attending an online charter school for a year is equivalent to missing 180 days of instruction in math, and 72 days of instruction in reading: https://credo.stanford.edu/pdfs/OnlineCharterStudyFinal2015.pdf\n\nJune Ahn (NYU) and Andrew McEachin (RAND) did a similar study of Ohio’s online charter schools and got similar results. They found that even high-achieving students who attending online charters in that state ended the year significantly behind their peers in brick-and-mortar schools: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X17692999\n\nThanks to folks at the National Education Policy Center for sharing their data on online charter enrollment from 2011 through 2016.

Link below\nThroughout much of the analog television era, Sony was the fairly undisputed king of TVs.  Their Trinitron picture tube was a universally well received technology and made a number of important improvements on the standard color picture tube.  This is the story of its creation.\n\n**The trinitron CRT wasn't impervious to Moire patterns.  However, it was less prone to them because of the lack of a phosphor grid.  Vertical misalignment could still occur with the aperture grille, so moire patterns could still appear on patterns with strong vertical stripes.  However, moire patterns wouldn't appear with horizontal image components due to the lack of distinct phosphor groupings.\n\n**The patent expired in 1996, not 1998.\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections\n\nThank you to all my current patrons!\nCharlie Quigley, Tommi Hares, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Brendan Sheehy, Jay Foreman, James Id, Howard Longden, Rich Theobald, Kyle Olson, Bryan Reid, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Alex Smith, Paul Williams, Ashleigh R, Stephen Bell, voodookidney, Örn Arnarson, Eric Wood, Stephen Pick, Stephen Vrazel, Paul Fisher, BlancoGrande, Matthew Giraitis, James Ryan, Robert Joscelyne, Ellis M.

Dragon will separate from Falcon 9’s second stage about 10 minutes after liftoff and attach to the space station on Wednesday, April 4.\n\nBoth Falcon 9 and the Dragon spacecraft for the CRS-14 mission are flight-proven. Falcon 9’s first stage previously supported the CRS-12 mission in August 2017 and Dragon previously supported the CRS-8 mission in April 2016.\n\nSpaceX will not attempt to recover Falcon 9’s first stage after launch.\n\nDragon will be filled with about 5,800 pounds of supplies, payloads and vehicle hardware, including critical materials to directly support science and research investigations that will occur onboard the orbiting laboratory.\n\nSpaceX CRS-14 is the fourteenth of up to 20 missions to the International Space Station that SpaceX will fly for NASA under the first CRS contract. In January 2016, NASA announced that SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft were selected to resupply the space station through 2024 as part of a second Commercial Resupply Services contract award. Under the CRS contracts, SpaceX has restored an American capability to deliver and return significant amounts of cargo, including live plants and animals, to and from the orbiting laboratory. A variant of the Dragon spacecraft, called Crew Dragon, is being developed for U.S.- based crew transport to and from the space station.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 4 International Space Station crew members will use the station’s 57.7-foot (17.6-meter) robotic arm to reach out and capture the Dragon spacecraft and attach it to the orbiting laboratory.\n\nDragon will return to Earth with more than 3,900 pounds of cargo after an approximately one-month stay at the International Space Station. About five hours after Dragon leaves the space station, it will conduct its deorbit burn, which lasts up to 10 minutes. It takes about 30 minutes for Dragon to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere and splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California.\n\nFor more information about the mission and payloads, visit www.nasa.gov/spacex.

25,258266,"""False""","""False""","How To Prep Before Grilling The Most Powerful Person On The Internet (HBO) VICE News Rep. Greg Walden, the chairman of the House committee that grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday, told VICE News it may be time for other tech CEOs to come before his committee to outline their own data privacy practices.\n\n“This is not just a Facebook issue,” he said in an interview, noting that other internet companies scrape and sell access to consumers’ data just like Facebook.\n\nWalden, an Oregon Republican, said he’d like to know from companies like Amazon or Google, “what are their protections, what are their user agreements? What should we know about their activities? What can they better regulate themselves, so we don't have to over-regulate here?” \n\nWalden chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Zuckerberg answered five hours worth of questions from members Thursday on everything ranging from its data sharing practices to its efforts to crack down on foreign election medddling. It was the Facebook CEO’s second round of questioning on the Hill, after he testified in front of a Senate panel on Tuesday — part of an apology tour on Capitol Hill meant to reassure lawmakers in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. \n\nWalden — an Oregon Republican whose district is home to three Facebook data centers — has been cautious on enacting new regulations to prevent similar abuses in the past. After Zuckerberg's testimony, Walden said he was still giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt when it came to implementing reforms to its data policies.\n\n“They've got to show the consumer just us the consumer that they understand their problem, they're going to fix it and we're not going to see another apology tour in six months or two years from now,” he said.\n\nIf Facebook fails to do so, Walden added, “there are things in terms of how we can better control our own data I think if they don't fix we can.”\n\nSubscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News\n\nCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.com\n\nFollow VICE News here:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenews\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenews\nTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vicenews\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo  chairman walden|""internet""|""VICE News Tonight""|""VICE News""|""greg walden""|""Greg Walden""|""Rep.

Plunging headlong into the campus experience, the increasingly outspoken Deanna—now Dee Rock—embraces freedom, fun and frat boys on her own terms, finding her true self in a senior year no one ever expected.\n\nThe film also stars Gillian Jacobs (“Don’t Think Twice,” “Love,” “Community”), Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids,” “Sisters”), Julie Bowen (“Modern Family”), Matt Walsh (“Veep,” “Ghostbusters”), Molly Gordon (“Love the Coopers,” “Animal Kingdom”), with Stephen Root (“Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”), and Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver (“Silver Linings Playbook,” “Animal Kingdom”), Jessie Ennis (“Better Call Saul”), Adria Arjona (“True Detective,” “Emerald City”), Debby Ryan (“Jessie”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Silicon Valley”).\n\nMcCarthy and Falcone co-wrote the screenplay and produced through their production company, On the Day. Chris Henchy also produced the film, with Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener, Michael Disco and David Siegel serving as executive producers.\n\nFalcone’s behind-the-scenes creative team included director of photography Julio Macat (“The Boss,” “Horrible Bosses 2,” “Daddy’s Home”); production designer Rusty Smith (“The Boss”); editor Brian Olds (“Central Intelligence”); and costume designer Louise Mingenbach (the “The Hangover” films).

In a world ravaged for years by a virus that turns the infected into zombie-like cannibals, a cure is at last found and the wrenching process of reintegrating the survivors back into society begins. Among the formerly afflicted is Senan (Sam Keeley), a young man haunted by the horrific acts he committed while infected. Welcomed back into the family of his widowed sister-in-law (Ellen Page), Senan attempts to restart his life—but is society ready to forgive him and those like him? Or will fear and prejudice once again tear the world apart? Pulsing with provocative parallels to our troubled times, The Cured is a smart, scary, and hauntingly human tale of guilt and redemption\n\nSubscribe to IFC: http://youtube.com/user/IFCFilmsTube\n\nConnect with IFC Online\nIFC Films Official Site: http://www.ifcfilms.com\nFollow IFC Films on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IFCFilms\nFind IFC Films on Facebook: http://facebook.com/IFCFilmsOfficial\nFollow IFC Films on Instagram : http://instagram.com/ifcfilms  IFC Films|""sundance selects""|""sundance""|""HD""|""official trailer""|""The Cured""|""disease""|""zombie""|""zombies""|""walking dead""|""apocalypse""|""cure""|""infected""|""discrimination""|""society""|""family""|""social""|""militant""|""government""|""horror""|""thriller""|""Ellen Page""|""Sam Keeley""|""Tom Vaughn-Lawlor""|""Stuart Graham""|""Peter Campion""|""Ireland""|""The Third Wave""|""social commentary""|""gore""|""violence""|""humanity""|""Paula Malcomson""",1.0,46.0,2018,1,2018,1

The true beauty of making useless things [is] this acknowledgment that you don't always know what the best answer is, Giertz says.

24,65678,"""False""","""False""","Will the Flash Movie (Flashpoint) Be Too Comedic in Tone? - Movie Talk ColliderVideos On this episode of Collider Movie Talk (Wednesday, January 17th, 2018) Mark Ellis, Jay Washington, Jon Schnepp, Kristian Harloff discuss the following:\n\n1) Flash’ Standalone Film Taps Directors John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein\n\n2) First Official Synopsis for ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Teases an Eventful Adventure\n\n3) First Trailer for Gus Van Sant’s: ‘Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot’ starring Joaquin Phoenix, Jack Black and Jonah Hill\n\n4) New ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ Image Shows Off the Title Team, All Suited Up\n\n5) New trailer released for Love, Simon\n\n6) Mail Bag \n\n7) Live Twitter Questions\n\nVariety is reporting that the Vacation helmers John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein are in negotiations to direct Flashpoint, the Flash’s standalone feature starring Ezra Miller. Interestingly enough, the studio initially asked Ben Affleck to return to the director’s chair, but he eventually passed. This comes as Warner Bros. begins reshuffling its D.C. properties, with New Line exec Walter Hamada recently promoted to oversee its comic book movies. \n\nDisney has released the first official synopsis for Solo: A Star Wars Story, the major new Star Wars movie that’s coming out in a little over four months. As part of Disney’s 2018 preview kit, the synopsis seems to tease the release of the first trailer, which should be coming any day now.\n\nAGREE OR DISAGREE\n\nAmazon Studios has released the first trailer for Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far on Foot. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, the film is based on the memoir of the same name by cartoonist, artist, and musician John Callahan. Joaquin Phoenix plays Callahan, who becomes a quadriplegic in a car accident at the age of 21 after a day of drinking. \n\nYesterday, Disney released its 2018 preview kit teasing their upcoming slate of films and inside featured the first official look at Hope Van Dyne alongside Scott Lang in Marvel’s upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly reprise their roles in the movie alongside Michael Peña and Michael Douglas, that will also introduce Hope’s mother, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. \n\n20th Century Fox has released a new trailer for Love, Simon. Based on Becky Albertalli’s novel, Greg Berlanti’s film follows seventeen-year-old Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who is currently grappling with how to tell his family and friends that he’s gay while also working to identify an anonymous classmate he’s fallen for online. The film is set for release on March 16th. \n\nMAIL BAG \n\nLIVE TWITTER QUESTIONS\n\nCheck out the YouTube Playlist for Awesometacular: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLayt6616lBckuUHPMdwFINi_vcyc-ysnC\n\nFollow us on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/ColliderVideo\nFollow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom\n\nFollow Mark: https://twitter.com/MarkEllisLive\nFollow Kristian: https://twitter.com/KristianHarloff\nFollow Schnepp: https://twitter.com/JonSchnepp\nFollow Jay: https://twitter.com/MrJayWashington\n\nAs the online source for movies, television, breaking news, incisive content, and imminent trends, Collider Videos is more than an essential destination.\n\nVisit Collider: http://collider.com\n\nFollow them on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Collider\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE SCHMOES YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE: https://www.youtube.com/user/schmoesknow\n\nCollider Show Schedule:\n\nMONDAY: TV Talk | http://bit.ly/29BR7Yi \n\nTUESDAY: Heroes | http://bit.ly/29F4Job\n\nTeam Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nWEDNESDAY: Nightmares | http://bit.ly/29BQUV3 \n\nTHURSDAY: Jedi Council | http://bit.ly/29v5wVi \n\nFRIDAY: Schmoedown | http://bit.ly/29C2iRV \n\nSATURDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd \n\nBehind the Scenes/Bloopers | http://bit.ly/2kuLuyI\n\nSUNDAY: Mailbag | http://bit.ly/29UsKsd\n\nMOVIE TALK: Every week day | http://bit.ly/29BRtOO  tobeornottobethatisthequestion|""ant-man""|""the wasp""|""flash""|""john francis daley""|""jonathan goldstein""|""solo: a star wars story""|""gus van sant""|""don't worry""|""he won't get far on foot""|""jonah hill""|""joaquin phoenix""|""jack black""|""love""|""simon""|""movie talk""|""mark ellis""|""jay washington""|""jon schnepp""|""kristian harloff""",5.0,125.0,2018,1,2018,1

It should end up looking like a small volcano. \nGradually add eggs in the volcano’s hole, and carefully incorporate eggs and flour.\nOnce all ingredients have been mixed, knead the dough by pulling, stretching, and folding for about 3-5 minutes, or until it turns elastic and semi-easy to mold. \nMold the dough into a sphere, and wrap it in plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes, or until the dough becomes more relaxed, elastic, and much easier to mold. \nCut the dough in four pieces. Grab the first one, and keep the other wrapped, or cover them with a slightly wet towel to keep them fresh. \nFlatten the first piece, and run it through the widest setting of your pasta maker. Increase the thinness number by one level each time you run the pasta through the machine. \nOnce you can see your fingers through the dough, proceed to cut the fettuccine, or any shape you wish. \nIn a pot with boiling water and salt, cook the pasta for 2 minutes or until it feels tender to the bite. \nServe with your favorite pasta sauce and enjoy!\nRecipe inspired by: http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/homemade-pasta-dough-420521\nAlso inspired by: http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/01/best-easy-all-purpose-fresh-pasta-dough-recipe-instructions.html\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nCredits: https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/40520\n\n\nMUSIC\nTEu\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nDaisychain_Instrumental\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nPrice Is Wrong_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nHolding Your Nerve_Full\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nLong Way To Go_FullMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nTour de Force_Full Mix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nWinner_Instrumental (1)\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nGet The Funny Thief_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_inst\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nAnother Day_fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nOrangenbaum_Fullmix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\nFifth Avenue_Undrscr\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nSTILLS\nSmall British kitten and bottle of milk\nOkssi68/Getty Images\nBrit Awards 2013 - Red Carpet Arrivals\nEamonn McCormack/Getty Images  homemade pasta|""homemade vs store bought""|""food wars""|""brenda buzzfeed""|""pasta""|""BuzzFeed""|""Tasty""|""BuzzFeed Tasty""|""italian""|""spaghetti""",4.0,103.0,2018,1,2018,1

I don’t think you should buy the iPhone X.\nFollow me on Twitter for giveaway - http://twitter.com/unboxtherapy\nSponsored by GoDaddy, check out GoCentral here - http://go2l.ink/lewis2\n\nThe iPhone X is the latest Apple flagship smartphone. With the iPhone X Apple has entered the realm of near bezel-less smartphones. The screen-to-body ratio on the iPhone X is one of the most impressive on the market. The camera on the iPhone X is also market leading and competitive with the Google Pixel 2 XL. Many users will be happy living with the iPhone X but I think the purchase is tough to justify. Given the emergence of truly high quality smartphone options retailing for half the price. Devices like the OnePlus 5T, Essential Phone, Razer Phone and even the heavily discounted Samsung Galaxy S8 offer better value for money. The iPhone X is not twice as good as any of those devices. Of course, this is my opinion… There is no perfect smartphone, just the best smartphone for you. The iPhone X will be great for some but I think most would be better served pocketing the extra $500 and grabbing something like the OnePlus 5T.\n__________________________________________\n\nWATCH SOME MORE VIDEOS...\n\nThe Super Smartphone You've Never heard Of...\nhttps://youtu.be/HkdoOyIRCj4?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nThis 3D Audio Experience Will Blow Your Mind (Wear Headphones)\nhttps://youtu.be/40r8JE7aVI8?list=PL7u4lWXQ3wfI_7PgX0C-VTiwLeu0S4v34\n\nHow LOUD Is The Razer Phone?

But when an even more unstoppable threat is unleashed to tear through our cities and bring the world to its knees, he is given one last chance to live up to his father’s legacy by his estranged sister, Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi)—who is leading a brave new generation of pilots that have grown up in the shadow of war. As they seek justice for the fallen, their only hope is to unite together in a global uprising against the forces of extinction. \n\nJake is joined by gifted rival pilot Lambert (The Fate of the Furious’ Scott Eastwood) and 15-year-old Jaeger hacker Amara (newcomer Cailee Spaeny), as the heroes of the PPDC become the only family he has left. Rising up to become the most powerful defense force to ever walk the earth, they will set course for a spectacular all-new adventure on a towering scale. \n\nPacific Rim Uprising is directed by Steven S. DeKnight (Netflix’s Daredevil, STARZ’s Spartacus) and also stars Jing Tian, Burn Gorman, Adria Arjona and Charlie Day. \n\n#JoinTheUprising #PacificRimUprising  pacific rim|""pacific rim uprising""|""legendary pictures""|""pacific rim movie""|""pacific rim uprising movie""|""new pacific rim movie""|""pacific rim 2""|""pacific rim sequel""|""john boyega movie""|""john boyega""|""scott eastwood""|""rinko kikuchi""|""charlie day""|""steven deknight""|""steven s deknight movie""|""cailee spaeny""|""mackenyu""|""wesley wong""|""new pacific rim trailer""|""new pacific rim 2 trailer""|""new john boyega movie""|""john boyega trailer""|""john boyega robot movie""",3.0,80.0,2018,1,2018,1

Next Independence Day, witness the rise of our country’s 12 hours of annual lawlessness.  Welcome to the movement that began as a simple experiment: The First Purge.\n \nTo push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community.  But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.\n\nComing off the most successful film in the series, The Purge: Election Year, creator James DeMonaco (writer/director of The Purge, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year) returns alongside the producers of this worldwide phenomenon: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious series, Get Out, Split), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).  \n\nThe First Purge is directed by Gerard McMurray (Burning Sands), working from a screenplay once again written by DeMonaco.  www.thefirstpurge.com  the purge|""the first purge""|""the purge trailer""|""the first purge trailer""|""purge state of the union spot""|""blumhouse""|""universal trailer""|""blumhouse trailer""|""state of the union""|""ylan noel""|""lex scott davis""|""joivan wade""|""jason blum""|""michael bay""|""andrew form""|""marisa tomei""|""the purge election year""|""the purge anarchy""",3.0,93.0,2018,1,2018,2

What software do you use?\nA. Simon's Cat is made using Adobe Flash / TV Paint / CelAction animation software.\n\nQ. Why does it take so long to make each Simon's Cat film?\nA. Animation is a slow process and Simon’s Cat films pay particular attention to observed, real life cat behaviour. Historically the films were traditionally animated frame by frame. More recently we use Celaction which has sped up the process but still requires a lot of care and attention. Each film takes approximately 6-9 weeks to make, depending on complexity, number of characters and special effects.\n\nQ. Where can I buy Simon’s Cat merchandise?\nA.

Pictures Watch the new trailer for #Mowgli starring Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch, Freida Pinto and Rohan Chand. Only in theaters October 19.--Motion capture and live action are blended for “Mowgli,” a new, big-screen, 3D adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s classic The Jungle Book.  The film features an impressive roster of stars under the direction of Andy Serkis.The story follows the upbringing of the human child Mowgli, raised by a wolf pack in the jungles of India.  As he learns the often harsh rules of the jungle, under the tutelage of a bear named Baloo and a panther named Bagheera, Mowgli becomes accepted by the animals of the jungle as one of their own.  All but one: the fearsome tiger Shere Khan.  But there may be greater dangers lurking in the jungle, as Mowgli comes face to face with his human origins.The actors performing the roles of the story’s central animal characters are: Oscar winner Christian Bale (“The Fighter,” the “Dark Knight” Trilogy) as the cunning panther, Bagheera; Oscar winner Cate Blanchett (“Blue Jasmine,” “The Aviator”) as the sinister snake, Kaa; Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch (“The Imitation Game,” “Avengers: Infinity War”) as the fearsome tiger, Shere Khan; Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight,” “Skyfall”) as Nisha, the female wolf, who adopts the baby Mowgli as one of her cubs; and Andy Serkis (the “Planet of the Apes” trilogy, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”) as the wise bear, Baloo.  On the human side, Matthew Rhys (“The Post”) is Lockwood; Freida Pinto (“Knight of Cups”) is Messua; and young actor Rohan Chand (“The Hundred-Foot Journey,” “Bad Words”) will play Mowgli, the boy raised by wolves.Rounding out the cast are Peter Mullan (“Tommy’s Honour”), as the leader of the wolf pack, Akela; Jack Reynor (“Transformers: Age of Extinction”), as Mowgli’s brother Wolf; Eddie Marsan (TV’s “Ray Donovan”), as Nisha’s mate, Vihaan; and Tom Hollander (“Breathe”) as the scavenging hyena, Tabaqui.“Mowgli” is produced by Steve Kloves (“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”), Jonathan Cavendish (“Breathe,” performance capture producer on “Godzilla”), and David Barron (the “Harry Potter” films), with Nikki Penny serving as executive producer.  The screenplay is by Kloves’ daughter, Callie Kloves.  Serkis’s creative filmmaking team includes director of photography Michael Seresin (“War for the Planet of the Apes”), production designer Gary Freeman (“Tomb Raider”) and editors Mark Sanger (Oscar winner, “Gravity”), Alex Marquez (“Snowden”) and Jeremiah O’Driscoll (“Flight”).

It's a simple question, though the answer is quite complicated. And it varies tremendously based on what car we're talking about. A $20,000 compact is far more simple than the $155,000 Mercedes S560 Cabriolet driven in this video. With that extra cost comes luxuriousness, the latest technology, and all kinds of features that most drivers will never even know the car has. \n\nOften, complexity is associated with unreliability, and though they may often correlate, that doesn't mean complexity causes unreliability. In the case of luxury cars, it's important to consider who the buyer is. In this video, we'll discuss why it may be a win-win for both manufacturers and consumers to have expensive cars that aren't necessarily reliable. \n\nEngineering Explained is a participant in the Amazon Influencer Program.\n\nDon't forget to check out my other pages below!\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/engineeringexplained\nOfficial Website: http://www.howdoesacarwork.com\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/jasonfenske13\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained\nCar Throttle: https://www.carthrottle.com/user/engineeringexplained\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/engineeringexplained\nEE Extra: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrY4q8xGPJQbQ8HPQZn6iA\n\nNEW VIDEO EVERY WEDNESDAY!  expensive car|""new car""|""used car""|""buy car""|""reliable car""|""luxury car""|""mercedes""|""mercedes s560""|""mercedes s560 cabriolet""|""daimler""|""luxury""|""expensive""|""brand new""|""cars""|""engineering explained""",14.0,345.0,2018,4,2018,4

Much to everyones surprise that film ended up becoming one of the highest grossing films in Dutch cinema history and a sequel seemed inevitable. That sequel is finally here and when they asked me to provide a title song once more I couldn't refuse.

General Motors didn’t share details on the diesel’s power output, but head of GM product development, Mark Reuss, assured us it would be more powerful than Ford’s new diesel in the F-150. The diesel and the 6.2 will be available with GM’s new Hydramatic 10-speed automatic transmission, while the 5.3 will come with the eight-speed.\n\nThe significant 450 lbs in weight savings come thanks to the use of aluminum in the hood, doors and rear liftgate. The vehicle’s ‘safety cage’ also uses seven different grades of steel to offer a good mix of lightness and strength. Furthermore, the front upper control arms are made of aluminum, while the rear springs are made of a new carbon-composite material, which shaves more pounds from the pickup.\n\nSubscribe\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=AutoGuideVideo\n\nYouTube - http://www.youtube.com/user/AutoguideVideo\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/AutoGuide\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/AutoGuide\nGoogle+ - http://goo.gl/LBxsP\nWeb - http://www.AutoGuide.com\n\nAutoGuide reviews the latest new cars with test drives, car comparisons and shootouts plus coverage of breaking auto industry news, auto shows, rumors and spy photos.
